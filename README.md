<h1>Executive Dashboard for A Bicycle Company</h1>

<h2>Overview </h2>

<b>Management is seeking insights into the company's sales performance and trends spanning from 2016 to 2018. They are particularly interested in understanding sales volume dynamics, revenue distribution across regions, stores, and product categories, as well as identifying top customers and sales representatives. Utilizing SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), data was processed and extracted to address these key areas of interest. The extracted data was then visualized using Tableau to develop an interactive executive dashboard.</b>

<h2>Problem Statement </h2>

<b>The bicycle company aims to enhance its sales analysis and decision-making process by developing an executive dashboard that provides comprehensive insights into sales performance and trends. The current lack of a centralized platform for analyzing revenue by month, store, state, category, top sales reps, and top customers hampers the company's ability to identify key opportunities for growth and optimize sales strategies effectively. Therefore, there is a need to develop an interactive executive dashboard that integrates data from various sources and presents it in a visually appealing and user-friendly format. This dashboard will enable stakeholders to gain actionable insights, make informed decisions, and drive business growth by leveraging sales data from the years 2016 to 2018.</b>
